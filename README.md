# City-Differences
The Project for my Big Data Course.

Based on one of the 2018 Yelp Data Challenges: Find the difference between Cities. Usung the busines dataset, I would use the cosine and similarity measures to determine the cities similarities. 

NOTE: Due to restraints on a daily API request limit of 80,000, this project would only use half of the 150,000 data entries.
